Practice
Capture the Flag (CTF) in computer security is an exercise in which "flags" are secretly hidden in purposefully-vulnerable programs or websites. Competitors steal flags either from other competitors (attack/defense-style CTFs) or from the organizers (jeopardy-style challenges). You can find the list of websites to practice CTF in Resources section.
